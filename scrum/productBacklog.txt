NAME     : Draw Circle
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
AS A     : user
I WANT   : To click the center of the circle, drag, and release to specify
           a circle to be drawn in the current style.
SO THAT  : I can add circles to my canvas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 6 : UTORID
NAME     : Circle drawing is broken
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : The first click should specify the center of the circle, with
           a drag for the radius. This is not the case in the current
           implementation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : USER STORY 2 : UTORID
NAME     : Draw Circle Feedback
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
AS A     : user
I WANT   : As a user is specifying a Circle, during the drag, a 'current'
           circle should be on display. As the user drags, the 'current'
           circle changes in real time so that a circle is drawn with
           centre at users initial circle click, with radius out to
           the current dragged mouse position.
SO THAT  : I can see the circle I am about to build on release of the mouse
           button.

PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
AS A     : user
I WANT   : To be able to select the current line thickness, to be applied
           to subsequent shapes. Example:
           		select fill style outline 
           		selects line thickness 1
           		mode circle
           		draw a circle

           		draw a rectangle
           		select line thickness 9
           		draw a rectangle
           		draw a rectangle
           		select mode squiggle
           		draw a squiggle
           	results in two thinly outlined circles and a thinly outlined 
           	rectangle as well as two thickly outlined rectangles and a thick squiggle

TYPE     : BUG 3 : UTORID
NAME     : Architecture behind choosing selection mode is poor
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : Code is not modular and is difficult to expand. Need a better
           architecture behind selecting a drawing mode, and handling
           the drawing events. Consider some design patterns here.
           Refactor ShapeChooserPanel and PaintPanel to get rid of the
           'if' blocks in the PaintPanel mouse event code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 4 : UTORID
NAME     : Architecture behind Model is poor
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : Having a list of different types of drawable things in the
           model is cumbersome. In fact, it is currently incorrect, with
           Squiggle's not drawing properly. Need to re-architect the Model
           so that it is more flexible, and easier to work with.
           Consider some design patterns, or change of responsibility
           here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 8 : UTORID
NAME     : Architecture for handling shape modifiers can be improved 
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : The architecture can be improved if we implement the Command Design 
Pattern to handle changes to the graphics contex such as changing drawing 
color, stroke width etc. You can accomplished this by wrapping the changes
to the graphics context in a DrawingCommand. This way these changes can be
added to the Bug 2.1 DrawingCommand list. That is, these new types of 
DrawingCommands appear on PaintPanel's list right along side 
the Shape type DrawingCommands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 9 : UTORID
NAME     : Architecture behind choosing drawing mode is poor
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : A better architecture behind selecting a drawing mode can be created 
by implementing the Factory Design Pattern as follows:

The factory design pattern should be used by the paint buttons. 
The factory is responsible for creating different ShapeManipulatorStrategy 
instances (see BUG 2.4). That is, when a button is pressed, the appropriate 
ShapeManipulatorStrategy is created and installed in the PaintPanel. 
Note that you can associate text with a button, even if you 
display an ImageIcon. The string attached to the button causes the right choice 
of object creation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 10 : UTORID
NAME     : Architecture behind creating shape instances is poor
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : A better architecture for creating shape instances so that it is 
more flexible, and easier to work with can be created using the Strategy Design 
pattern as follows:

Create class/abstract class/interface  ShapeManipulatorStrategy as well 
as subclasses/implementators for each type of Shape. Call these the
concrete ShapeNamipulatorStrategies

The concrete ShapeManipulatorStrategies are responsible for 

1. Creating instances of Shape and putting them on top of 
   the PaintModel command stack.

2. Understanding how mouse events modify the shape at the top of the 
   PaintModel command stack.	

3. Calling the PaintPanel repaint at appropriate times.

This strategy can be put in place either by having PaintPanel's mouse 
events forwarded through PaintPanel into the current strategy, or by 
simply switching the PaintPanel's event handlers as appropriate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 12 : UTORID
NAME     : Drawing is lagging, and drawing modes arent synched
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : After drawing a few shapes the whole paint application lags. And drawing circles
isnt synched with drawing rectangles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 13 : UTORID
NAME     : Line thickness selector needs more options
OWNER    : oliynyk2
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : theres only 3 options for line thickness, need to make more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 14 : UTORID
NAME     : Fill or No Fill buttons look really bad and get in the way.
OWNER    : oliynyk2
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : Change locations or the way Fill/No Fill is done.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : USER STORY 10 : UTORID
NAME     : Make the Screen Resizable
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : Let the screen be resizable. So that the shapes stay in the same
			place after a resize.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 14 : UTORID
NAME     : Square is broken
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : When drawing a square you can move it up and down while not releasing
			the mouse button
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : USER STORY 8 : UTORID
NAME     : Implement Poly Line
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : first click sets first point, all other clicks draw polyline there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 5 : UTORID
NAME     : Squiggle is broken
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : Squiggles are connected to each other by a straight line. Each drag
		   of the mouse should be a separate squiggle. Possibly
           the issue is with the representation of the squiggles in the Model.
