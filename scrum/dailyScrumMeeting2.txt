	Today     :Michael and Ifinished off bug10 pretty much. Ended up fixing a problem that was bugging us for hours yesterday, shape wasnt being referenced corrrectly causing a null pointer exception..
		   The architecture had only circle implemented. I implemented the rest.

	Yesterday :^
	Today     :Ended up fixing the NPE. Turns out a small spelling error cause this one. Noticed command design wasnt implemented 100%, added the "invoker" so that all shapes can be drawn to the screen at once and not just the one that the
		   mode is selected for.
	Obstacles :Memory problems. After a few shapes the app slows down. Going to have another group member look at it. Michael and I have been stressing over this assignment like crazy past 2 days. We have other class work to do.
		    Our other group members can fix this one.
